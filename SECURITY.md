## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability you can use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Authentication/security/advisories)
or via email to security@idunno.org.

I will try to acknowledge your email within 48 hours, but please keep in mind this is a "spare-time" project.
After the initial reply to your report, the security I will endeavor to keep you informed of how a fix is progressing
and when you can expect it to be delivered. I may ask for additional information on the bug.

Please reproduce your bug on the latest supported version published on nuget.org

## Disclosure Policy

When diagnosing a security bug the following steps are

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to nuget.

I would prefer report remain confidential until a fix is released, or I decide it is not an issue, but I acknowledge that some have other feelings about disclosure policies.
